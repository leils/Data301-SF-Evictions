    "# Evictions: Trends in San Francisco\n",
    "\n",
    "*Please note: Included in these notebooks is data from the SFPD on incidents in the Mission from 2003. The SFPD data did not end up suiting the models I wanted to create, nor provided insight into evictions. Thus, there are explorations of the data, and an unusable model that I have created from it. These are not included in the presentation, and the commentary in the following notebooks reflects this. *\n",

    "Is there any way that we can see this change? \n",
    "Can we predict number of evictions over time?\n",
